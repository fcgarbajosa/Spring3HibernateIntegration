Zooplus Senior Developer Challenge
Author: Fidel C. Garbajosa. February 2016

This application has been developed on Tomcat and OpenJDL 8 with Eclipse MARS.
The Database server is a remote MySQL provider: sql4.freemysqlhosting.net

The simplest way to get a WAR file is using the Export option in Eclipse after
selecting the project, called Spring3HibernateIntegration

Database is blank now so you will have to register. Once you has been registered
you can get the currency values clicking "Get currency values" on Home screen.

I made my App available via Internet on Heroku, as you said on your Requeriments Document.
Please be aware that having an external MySQL provider could cause some time-out exceptions.
You should reload the page to see it. You can find my App on this url:

Feel free to ask...
